This is a description.

TODO-list (in priority order):
  * use a specific library to get a nicer graph;
  * let the user delete a node from the graph;
  * let the application status be visualized in the status bar (especially when loading to/retrieving from a datase or executing one of the real-life scripts);
  * let the user choose the database name when saving/loading;
  * implement the creation of advanced objects (non only hosts);
  * implement manual connection between two nodes;
  * add a command-line option which allows to load directly from a database;
  * add a command-line option which allows to keep an underlying database in sync with ORM entries when Nodes are updated via the GUI.
